                     My interest in Computer Science came from my enthusiasm for computers when I was young, mainly from loving the game World of Warcraft. I was always interested in anything related to digital technology, and so when my high school offered the "Intro to Java" class I was stoked to enroll. I wrote my first "hello world" program in Java when I was in the 10th grade and have been programming ever since. I'm ardent about Computer Science because it gives me the knowledge to understand how computers are able to do what they do. I am intrigued by how typing certain words and numbers together you can make anything you envision to show up on your screen, it's almost like magic.

                <p>
                    After college I am still motivated to learn more about programming, creating projects to further hone my skills, I am in the process of gaining a higher level of programming mastery and hope to present my skills to show my future employer what I am capable of.

                    Here I learned advanced topics of Computer Scienece ranging from Algorithms and Data Structures to System Architecture and Database Design, I really enjoyed my time at Stony Brook because of the relationships I developed with my peers. They were there to help me all the way, whether it was academic advice or personal advice.

                Stony Brook showed me how to discipline myself, it showed me how difficult programming can be but through hard work and perseverance I was able to solve my problems and came out the school with much better coding practices.

                            A Spring application with a MySQL database, my final project of my undergraduate career. I worked on a team of four with me being the lead programmer. My job was to help with both the front end and back end. The hardest part was connecting the two together. I gained valuable experience working on a team.
